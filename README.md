# propeller-OpenFOAM
Case files and tutorial for propeller meshing and simulation using cfMesh and OpenFOAM

Only case files are here. You must generate the mesh with the files in mesh/ directory and then copy the constant/polymesh directory to the simulationTemplate/ in order to simulate it. 

The guide to meshing and simulation is found in SetupOpenFOAM.pdf file. 

Enjoy it!
